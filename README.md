Project Overview: Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

Objective:

  •The objective of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. The goal is to split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²), and make predictions on the test set. Additionally, visualizations of the regression line and actual vs. predicted values will be created to assess the model's accuracy.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the Housing dataset. It contains various features related to housing attributes, such as:
 •longitude
 •latitude
 •housing_median_age
 •total_rooms
 •total_bedrooms
 •population
 •households
 •median_income
 •median_house_value

For this project, the `median_income` will be used as the feature (independent variable) and `median_house_value` as the target (dependent variable).

Steps Involved:

1. Loading the Dataset:
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Display the column names to understand the dataset structure.

2. Data Exploration:
   - Display basic information about the dataset.
   - View the first few rows of the dataset.
   - Generate summary statistics for the dataset.
   - Check for missing values in the dataset.

3. Data Visualization:
   - Visualize the distribution of the target variable (`median_house_value`) using a histogram.

4. Data Preparation:
   - Select `median_income` as the feature and `median_house_value` as the target variable.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.

5. Model Training:
   - Train a simple linear regression model using the training data.

6. Model Evaluation:
   - Make predictions on the test set.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.

7. Visualization of Results:
   - Plot the regression line over the scatter plot of the test data to visualize the model's fit.
   - Create a scatter plot to visualize actual vs. predicted values, along with a reference line.

Tools and Libraries:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- Seaborn: For making statistical graphics and visualizations.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning model training and evaluation.

Conclusion:
This project provides a detailed approach to implementing and evaluating a simple linear regression model. By visualizing the regression line and comparing actual vs. predicted values, we can assess the model's accuracy and gain insights into its performance.
